# Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.


### What is the primary goal of TDD?
The goal of TDD is specification and not validation 

Using TDD, one thinks through the requirements or design before writing functional code
